		<h1>About Me</h1>

		<p>I am a computer-integrated shorthand expert, aficionado, and practitioner, living in Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A. I became interested in Front-End Web Design and Development because I love to use computers to enable production of text quickly, efficiently and with highest accuracy.</p>

		<h2>My Mission</h2>

		<p>My goal is to learn to code for efficient data management that populates interactive websites.</p>

		<h2>My Experience</h2>
		
		<p>This is how I have evolved professionally:</p>

		<br>
		<li><strong>Beekkeeper/Apiarist</strong>, self-employed, Phoenix, Arizona</li>

		<br>
		<li><strong>Audio Visual Technician/Photographer</strong>, f-Stop, Inc., Phoenix, Arizona</li>

		<br>
		<li><strong>Freelance Court Reporter</strong>, Northern District Reporters, Inc., Chicago, Illinois</li>

		<br>
		<li><strong>Official Court Reporter</strong>, U.S. District Court, Chicago, Illinois</li>

	</ul></p>
			<h2>Other</h2>
			<p>My first project will be to create a website with a goal of finding homes for my five - yes, FIVE - orphaned kittens. They are now six weeks old. I want to use my skills developed during this course to create an attractive site so my kittens will be exposed to a large number of prospective stable families for their future health and happiness.  If you are interested in contributing ideas for my website, feel free to email me at: <a href=
